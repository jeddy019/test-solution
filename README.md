# Scandiweb Junior Developer test assignment

#### By Jedidiah Akinboyowa for the Junior React Developer position at Scandiweb.

### About

Learned quite a lot in this React test. Invested a lot of time and it was all worth it in the end because I gained a lot of knowledge during the course of this project.

PS: I made some changes based on the detailed feedback I got on my first submission of the React Test.
